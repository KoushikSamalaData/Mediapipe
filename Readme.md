# MediaPipe Computer Vision Projects 

This repository contains a collection of real-time computer vision applications using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Python. These projects demonstrate various capabilities such as hand tracking, face mesh, object detection, 3D bounding boxes, pose estimation, and more.

## üîç Overview

Each Python script is a self-contained demo showing how to leverage MediaPipe's powerful models for real-time inference. These can be used for prototyping AR applications, gesture control systems, fitness tracking, and more.

# üéØ Real-Time Face & Pose Detection with MediaPipe

This repository features **three Python projects** that demonstrate real-time and static image-based **face and human pose detection** using **[Google's MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)** and **OpenCV**. These scripts show how to perform:

- Real-time face detection via webcam
- Full-body pose tracking using BlazePose in real-time
- Static image pose detection with segmentation


### ‚úÖ 5. `Object Detection with Web Cam using MediaPipe.py`

**Purpose**: Real-time **face detection** using your computer's webcam.

**Key Features**:
- Utilizes `mediapipe.solutions.face_detection` for lightweight detection.
- Annotates faces using MediaPipe‚Äôs built-in drawing utilities.
- Displays the feed with detected faces in a mirrored (selfie-view) display.
- Exits the program when `Esc` is pressed.

**How It Works**:
1. Captures video using OpenCV.
2. Converts frames from BGR ‚Üí RGB.
3. Detects faces with MediaPipe.
4. Draws detections and flips the image for display.
5. Runs in a loop until `Esc` is pressed.

### ‚úÖ 6. `On-device, Real-time Body Pose Tracking with MediaPipe BlazePose.py`

**Purpose**: Track full-body pose landmarks in **real-time** using BlazePose.

**Key Features**:
- Uses `mediapipe.solutions.pose` for upper/lower body tracking.
- Detects and connects 33 pose landmarks.
- Continuously renders landmarks on live webcam frames.
- Exits the program when the `q` key is pressed.

**How It Works**:
1. Initializes BlazePose with detection and tracking confidence.
2. Captures and flips webcam input.
3. Processes each frame for pose estimation.
4. Draws landmarks using MediaPipe‚Äôs connections.
5. Displays results in real-time.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. `Pose landmark detection using MediaPipe.py`

**Purpose**: Detect pose landmarks on a **static image** and visualize the result.

**Key Features**:
- Loads and processes a static image with MediaPipe Pose.
- Enables segmentation and uses high model complexity for detailed results.
- Displays annotated results using `matplotlib`.

**How It Works**:
1. Loads an image from a specified path (you need to update the path).
2. Converts the image to RGB format.
3. Processes the image to detect pose landmarks.
4. Draws landmarks and connections with custom styling.
5. Displays the annotated image using Matplotlib.
